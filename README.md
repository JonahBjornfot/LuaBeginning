This is a game where you click the buttons 1, 2, 3 or 4 to gain score. You have 30 secounds to collect as much score as possible. But be sure to not pause or press the wrong button because you will lose score! (Debug console is not needed anymore, fixed that problem)

Download trought the green "code" button and then "Download zip". At last open the map in Visual Studio Code and run the game!
