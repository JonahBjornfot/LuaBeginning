# Spamklicker
This is a game where you click the buttons 1, 2, 3 or 4 to gain score. You have 30 secounds to collect as much score as possible. But be sure to not pause or press the wrong button because you will lose score! (Debug console is not needed anymore, fixed that problem)

Download trought the green "code" button and then "Download .zip". At last open the .zip, extract and run the Spamklickers.exe file!

Or

Clone it to your computer trought Windows powershell etc, extract the .zip file and run the Spamklickers.exe file!'
