This is a game where you click the buttons 1, 2, 3 and 4 to gain score. You have 30 secounds to collect as much score as possible. But be sure to not pause or press the wrong butten because then you will lose score! (Debug console isnt needed anymore, fixed that problem)

Download trought the green "code" button and then "Download zip". Then open the map in Visual Studio Code and run the game!
(Requiers that Love2D is installed)

Or

Clone it to your computer and run!
